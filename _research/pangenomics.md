This project works on developing novel representations and analyses for multiomic pangenomic data to aid in the interrogation and manipulation of plant genetic diversity.
The exponential growth of complete, high-quality genomes and functional sequencing datasets 
has created opportunity for algorithmic innovation.  We are developing
new techniques for representing and analyzing multi-omic pangenomic data,
including connecting genomic regions to phenotypes such as expression levels and climate adaptation.
