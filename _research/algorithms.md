I also like to work on basic algorithms and optimization problems from time to time, and have recently worked on several interesting problems including improving the state-of-the-art algorithms for finding the minimum path cover of a DAG (see picture below), decomposing a flow network into a minimum number of path flows, and a job scheduling problem to minimize peak demand (relevant to smart power grids).
