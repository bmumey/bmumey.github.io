I teach a variety of courses at MSU at the both the undergraduate and graduate level, mostly algorithms and data structures related.  In upper-division and graduate courses I typically incorporate some kind of mini research project.

Some recent courses:

- CSCI 232: Data Structures and Algorithms (Spring 2021)
    - [Syllabus](/files/pdf/teaching/Syllabus (232Sp21).pdf)
- CSCI 246: Discrete Structures (Spring 2024)
    - [Syllabus](/files/pdf/teaching/Syllabus (246Sp24).pdf)
- CSCI 451-551: Computational Biology (Fall 2023)
    - [Syllabus](/files/pdf/teaching/Syllabus (451-551Fa23).pdf)
- CSCI 532: Algorithms (Spring 2023)
