Welcome!  I am a faculty member in the [Gianforte School of Computing](https://www.gsoc.montana.edu) at [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu). 
My research interests are broadly in applied algorithms, including computational biology and optimization problems, and I am part of the [Applied Algorithms Group](https://www.gsoc.montana.edu/aalab.html).

*I am actively recruiting new PhD students*. Please see my Research projects and contact me if you are interested in participating in one.  Prospective students should have a strong math/algorithms or biology background.

My publications can be found on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gw5eQs8AAAAJ) and I am also on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brendan-Mumey).  I enjoy collaborating on new topics; please get in touch if you might like to work on something.

I have a PhD in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu) from the [University Washington](https://www.washington.edu), an MS in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca) from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca) and a BS in [Mathematics](https://www.math.ualberta.ca) from the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca).
